# Outline of data extraction and model building

Hello! You used the QR code, nice, all that talk about machine learning and Heusler alloys on the poster, it was not made up! 
This github repository contains two python scripts which give an outline of the machine learning work done in this project. A more visually Assuming you are on mobile, click on 'View code' to get taken to the code. 

Click on "View all of README.md" to get a description of the two files

## data_extraction.py

This file contains the code which created a dataset containing all Heulser alloys which have been simulated on AFLOW.

## making_models.py

This file outlines the code used to build machine learning models once you have the appropriate. It also contains a link to a more visually appealing presentation of this code

If you want to run with the code here you may need to install some python libraries.

## Requirements
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* pickle
* aflow 
* tqdm

There are a myriad of ways to install these libraries, all described online!
