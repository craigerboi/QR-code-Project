# Outline of data extraction and model building
```
Hello! You used the QR code, nice, all that talk about machine learning and Heusler alloys on the poster, it was not made up! This github repository contains two jupyter notebooks which give an outline of the machine learning work done in this project. Click on 'view code' to get taken to the code.
```
#Data_extraction_outline.ipynb 

This file contains the code which created a dataset containing all Heulser alloys which have been simulated on AFLOW.
```
#Making_models.ipynb

This file outlines the code used to build machine learning models once you have the appropriate.
```
If you want to run with the code here you may need to install some python libraries.

## Requirements
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* pickle
* aflow 
* tqdm

There are a myriad of ways to install these libraries, all described online!
